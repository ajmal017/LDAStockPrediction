# LDAStockPrediction
Understanding the mutual relationship between information flows and social activity in today's society is one of the cornerstones of the social sciences. In financial economics, the key issue in this regard is understanding and quantifying how news of all possible types (geopolitical, environmental, social, financial, economic, etc.) affects the trade and the pricing of companies in the stock market. With the introduction of text mining, studies have been conducted to analyze specific themes and trends in different documents collections. Trend analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in text mining is adopted as one of trend analysis methods with the highest precision. In this thesis, we will analyze the LDA analysis method. This method consists of 5 steps and trend analysis is performed by "topic" using the extracted result combining LDA and the most relevant keywords. By applying our method and LDA to news articles, we perform topic modeling and we check for relevant trends in a past or in a present time period. We will show how the entire news scene affecting the stock market movements could be summarized through regressions between the trading activity and the pieces on information thanks to these simple topic modeling techniques, according to their theme. By using these methods, we will be able to estimate and quantify the news impact on the market.
